This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML/JavaScript bug where a div element is hidden but lacks a mechanism to restore its visibility. The bug is in the `myFunction` which hides the div with `style.display = "none"`, but doesn't offer a way to show the div again. The solution adds a toggle functionality.
